        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            The ultimate recipe for brownies! They're fudgy, moist, and super chocolaty, with perfect crispy edges.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>8 ounce marscapone cheese, room temperature</li>
            <li>1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups cold espresso</li>
            <li>3 Tablespoons coffe flavoured liquer</li>
            <li>1 package Lady Fingers</li>
            <li>Cocoa powder for dusting on top</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add whipping cream to a mixing bowl and beat on medium speed with electric mixers (or use a stand mixer). 
                Slowly add sugar and vanilla and continue to beat until stiff peaks. 
                Add mascarpone cheese and fold in until combined. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Add coffee and liqueur to a shallow bowl. 
                Dip the lady fingers in the coffee (Don't soak them--just quickly dip them on both sides to get them wet) and 
                lay them in a single layer on the bottom of an 8x8'' or similar size pan. </li>
            <li>Smooth half of the mascarpone mixture over the top. 
                Add another layer of dipped lady fingers. Smooth remaining mascarpone cream over the top.</li>
            <li>Dust cocoa powder generously over the top 
                (I use a fine mesh strainer to do this). Refrigerate for at least 3-4 hours or up to overnight before serving.</li>
        </ol>
